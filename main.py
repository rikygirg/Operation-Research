            What's next??

1)  Not sure the program works where no admissible basis 
    can be found. Implement Phase I simplex

2)  The algo does not manage the case of an illimitate 
    problem. Add limitation clause in the j = argmin section

3)  Test the script for performance in terms of execution 
    time and memomary management, I bet there's still a lot 
    of room for improvement. Develop an actual benchmark, 
    not the one currently implemented

4)  Adapt the optimum outcome to the actual scope, wether a 
    maximization or minimization
    
5)  Implement other methods to solve a linear programming 
    problem.
